# Database-Driven Web Application

A full-stack web application developed as part of a team project for a university Database Systems course. The app mimics a simplified version of the university's SIS (Student Information System). The app is built using PHP and MySQL and was designed to demonstrate concepts in relational database design, SQL operations, input validation, and web-based data interaction.

Check out the [Phase 3 Android App project here](https://github.com/Soren64/your-android-app-repo) for the mobile implementation of the database system.

- Designed and imported normalized relational schemas.
- Allows user interactions via web interface (CRUD operations, form handling).
- Validates user input to preserve data integrity.
- Follows a structured setup using XAMPP for local development.
