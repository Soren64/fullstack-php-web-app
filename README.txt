Setup: After downloading these files, move this folder into the xampp\htdocs
    directory on your computer. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control
    panel. Navigate to "localhost" in a web browser and open phpMyAdmin from
    the XAMPP dashboard. Create a new database called "DB2". Click on this
    new database, then on the "import" tab. Click on "Choose File" and select
    the "DB2-tables.sql" file contained in this folder (which should now be
    located in xampp/htdocs) from the dialogue box, then hit "Import" at the
    bottom of the page.

To Run: Go through the Setup procedure if you have not already. Start Apache
    and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel if you have not already. Open a
    web broser and navigate to "localhost/db2".
